I'm Josh Richard, I'm a programmer in Canada. 20 years ago I started programming with QBasic before discovering Visual Basic which became the gateway to C#. I've made a career of developing apps with C# including learning management and data analysis systems. I created this blog to chronicle some of my hobby projects in all areas of my life including program development. My house is an ongoing project that friends and family help with. 

When I'm not in front of a computer I spend time focuing on fitness, gaming, and stuffing my face with sushi.
